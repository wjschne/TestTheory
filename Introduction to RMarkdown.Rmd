**Note**: In order to compile this document, save the following files to the same folder as [this document](http://my.ilstu.edu/~wjschne/442/Introduction%20to%20RMarkdown.Rmd):

* [APA.docx](http://my.ilstu.edu/~wjschne/442/APA.docx) This file is a template to create MS Word documents in APA Style. The template is a work in progress and thus does not get everything exactly right.
* [APAStyle.css](http://my.ilstu.edu/~wjschne/442/APAStyle.css) This file provides APA-like styling for HTML output. You can make .css files to format text and other HTML elements in almost any way you want.
* [apa.csl](http://my.ilstu.edu/~wjschne/442/apa.csl) This file tells R Markdown how to format citations in APA Style.
* [citations.bib](http://my.ilstu.edu/~wjschne/442/citations.bib) This file contains a few citations in BibTeX format.

# R Markdown

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) is a really simple way to format documents. [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a variant of Markdown that works in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

# This is a Level 1 header

This is a regular paragraph. Extra       spaces between words are eliminated.
Even though this 
sentence is broken
across many lines, 
it is
grouped with the text
above it.

Put an empty line between paragraphs.

You can't see them but if you put 2 or more spaces  
at the end  
of a line,  
there is a line break.

## This is a Level 2 header

### Guess which level header this is!

# Formatting text

*This is italicized.*

**This is bolded.**

~~Strikethrough~~

Superscript^2^

>This is for blockquotes.
>It can go on for 
>many
>lines.
>
>This is the second paragraph in a blockquote. In my .css file, I  have formatted it so that it will be indented.



```
Text enclosed in three backquotes (```) will appear in a monospace type. It will appear exactly 
as
   you 
       type it,
without the typical formatting.

For example,
*normally this would be italicized.*
```

# Lists
Let's make an unordered list

* First bullet point
* Second bullet point
    - Indented bullet point (2 tabs or 4 spaces)
    - Another indented bullet point
        + Further indentation (4 tabs or 8 spaces)

Let's make an ordered list

1. My first topic
    1. Sub topic 1
    2. Sub topic 2
2. My second topic
    * Subtopic (2 tabs or 4 spaces)
    * Another subtopic    
    This is a indented paragraph in the middle of a list (2 tabs or 4 spaces).
    * Yet another subtopic
3. My third topic

# Combining R and Markdown

## R code chunks

```{r}
EvenNumbersUnder100<-seq(2,98,2)
```

This code chunk will run but it will not appear in the document.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
X<-cos(pi)
```

This code chunk will appear in the document but it will not run.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
Y<-tan(pi/4)
```

## Inline R code

You can refer to calculations in your text. For example, the cosine of $\pi$ radians is `r cos(pi)`. In fact, you can refer to any R object (e.g., the mean and standard deviation of a variable.)

## Let's make a pretty plot with R:

```{r,dev='svg',echo=-1}
# If converting to Word, change dev to png.
par(family = "serif")
x <- 0:20
y <- dpois(x,lambda = 3)
plot(y~x,type="b",col="royalblue2",lty=3,pch=19,main=expression("Poisson Distribution "*(lambda == 3)),xlab="Sample Space",ylab="Probability",bty="n",las=1)
```

## APA Formatted tables!
```{r,results='asis'}
n<-1000 #Sample size
g<-rnorm(n) #Normal variate
s1<-g+rnorm(n) #Correlated variate
s2<-g+rnorm(n) #Correlated variate
d<-cbind(g,s1,s2) #Bind columns into a matrix
dcor<-round(cor(d),2) #Correlation matrix (rounded to 2 digits)
dcor[lower.tri(dcor,diag=TRUE)]<-"" #Remove lower triangle
knitr::kable(dcor,align = "c") #Make table with centered columns
```

# Citations

As explained [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html), if you use the bibliography tag, you can insert citations with the @ symbol and the citation's unique ID. A variety of citation file formats are supported and a huge number of citation styles are [available](https://zotero.org/styles). I am using the [BibTeX file format](http://www.bibtex.org/) with the [APA (6^th^ Edition) citation style](https://zotero.org/styles/apa).

For example, here are some recent papers of mine [@schneider2013principles; @kahn2013s]. In this paper, @schneider2013if [p. 186-187] says a bunch of stuff. 

 Tools like these make managing references much, much easier than doing it all by hand. The references below appear like magic, all perfectly formatted.
